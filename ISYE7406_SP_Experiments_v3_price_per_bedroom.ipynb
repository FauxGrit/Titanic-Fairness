        "> The setup() function initializes the environment in pycaret and creates the transformation pipeline to prepare the data for modeling and deployment. setup() must be called before executing any other function in pycaret. It takes two mandatory parameters: a pandas dataframe and the name of the target column. All other parameters are optional and are used to customize the pre-processing pipeline (we will see them in later tutorials).\n",
        "\n",
        "> When setup() is executed, PyCaret's inference algorithm will automatically infer the data types for all features based on certain properties. The data type should be inferred correctly but this is not always the case. To account for this, PyCaret displays a table containing the features and their inferred data types after setup() is executed. If all of the data types are correctly identified enter can be pressed to continue or quit can be typed to end the expriment. Ensuring that the data types are correct is of fundamental importance in PyCaret as it automatically performs a few pre-processing tasks which are imperative to any machine learning experiment. These tasks are performed differently for each data type which means it is very important for them to be correctly configured.\n",

        "> Two simple words of code (not even a line) have created over 22 models using 10 fold cross validation and evaluated the 6 most commonly use regression metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, RMSLE and MAPE). The score grid printed above highlights the highest performing metric for comparison purposes only. The grid by default is sorted using R2 (highest to lowest) which can be changed by passing sort parameter. For example compare_models(sort = 'RMSLE') will sort the grid by RMSLE (lower to higher since lower is better). If you want to change the fold parameter from the default value of 10 to a different value then you can use the fold parameter. For example compare_models(fold = 5) will compare all models on 5 fold cross validation. Reducing the number of folds will improve the training time."

        "> While compare_models() is a powerful function and often a starting point in any experiment, it does not return any trained models. PyCaret's recommended experiment workflow is to use compare_models() right after setup to evaluate top performing models and finalize a few candidates for continued experimentation. As such, the function that actually allows to you create a model is unimaginatively called create_model(). This function creates a model and scores it using stratified cross validation. Similar to compare_models(), the output prints a score grid that shows MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2, RMSLE and MAPE by fold.\n",
